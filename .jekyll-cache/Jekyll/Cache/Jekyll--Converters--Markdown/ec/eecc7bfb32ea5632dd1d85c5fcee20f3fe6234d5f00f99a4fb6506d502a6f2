<p><img src="/assets/images/gen/content/profile.png" /></p>

<p>I have more than 15 years experience in product and UX design, product management, leadership, web development and customer success. I have worked in many different types of businesses with a diverse range of people.</p>

<p>I strongly believe that creating great product is a team sport. I have spent my career working in cross functional teams collaborating with team mates and stakeholders in order to deliver the best outcomes for customers.</p>

<p>I have also managed and led product teams. Using my experience to coach, support and mentor others to do their best work is something that I get great satisfaction from.</p>

<p>Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my family, squash, skiing, swimming, cooking and travelling.</p>
