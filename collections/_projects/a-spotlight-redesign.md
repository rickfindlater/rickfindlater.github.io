### The Opportunity

I joined **Spotlight Reporting** as the first dedicated product designer, and it quickly became evident that there was significant work to be done in both UI and UX design. The product had evolved over time, but design had not kept pace, creating an opportunity to enhance usability and modernise the experience.

### My Role

Given the scale of the challenge, a full redesign of all Spotlight products at once was impractical. Instead, I collaborated with stakeholders and cross-functional team members to identify high-impact areas to prioritise. Once these areas were defined, I led the process from concept through to delivery.

### Step One: Research & Product Audit

The first step was conducting a comprehensive audit of Spotlightâ€™s products. This involved:
- Analysing **user feedback** and **analytics data** to uncover pain points.
- Collaborating with **stakeholders and the product team** to assess areas with the most opportunity for improvement.

Through this research, we identified two key areas to focus on first: 
- The **organisation dashboard**.
- The **data import process**.

### Step Two: Brainstorming, Concept Development & Wireframing

With a clear direction, I presented my findings to stakeholders and the cross-functional team. We then ran a brainstorming session to explore potential improvements. From these discussions, we identified several promising approaches.

I then worked with the team to develop concepts and wireframes, visualising possible solutions. We reviewed these together to determine the most viable options to move forward with.

### Step Three: Refining Designs & Supporting Development

Once a preferred approach was selected, I collaborated with the team to refine the designs. Having already established the foundation of a new design system for Spotlight, I applied this to ensure consistency across the redesign.

To support the development process, I:
- Held a **story mapping session** to outline the development flow.  
- Collaborated closely with **developers**, clarifying design intent, answering questions, and creating additional assets as needed.  

### The Future

Following the release of the redesigned screens, we monitored analytics and gathered user feedback to plan further iterations. Looking ahead, we aim to continue the redesign across other areas of the product, building on the improvements already made.
