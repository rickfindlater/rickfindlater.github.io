### The Opportunity
With **AI** becoming increasingly prevalent among SaaS providers, **Spotlight** needed to develop a clear AI strategy. Many of our competitors had already launched AI integrations, so we had to take a responsible, staged approach to adopting this technology in a way that aligned with our vision and delivered real value to our users.

### My Role
I was involved in this project from its inception, playing a key role from **initial research** and **product design**,  through to the release of our **first MVP** and beyond.

### Step One: Research
Due to the commercial sensitivity of the project, we had to be cautious about revealing our AI strategy too early to competitors. As a result, we couldn’t conduct fresh user interviews initially. Instead, we leveraged existing interview data and conducted a thorough review of customer feedback to identify the most valuable **AI-driven opportunities** for our product.

In parallel, I performed an **in-depth analysis** of our competitors’ AI offerings and explored how companies in adjacent industries were using AI. This research was supplemented with extensive exploration of **emerging AI technologies** to understand their capabilities and potential applications within our product.

### Step Two: Brainstorming & Initial concepts and wireframes
Once the research phase was complete, I presented my findings to key stakeholders and the cross-functional team. Together, we conducted a **brainstorming session** to explore possible AI integrations. From these discussions, we identified several promising directions, which I then translated into **wireframes**.

We reviewed the wireframes collectively and identified the most viable approach to move forward with.

### Step Three: Refining Designs & Supporting Development
After selecting the preferred approach, I collaborated with the team to refine the design details. We conducted a **story mapping session** to outline the development process before moving into the implementation phase.

As development progressed, I transitioned into a **production design role**, where I worked closely with developers to ensure clarity around design intent, answered questions, and created additional assets as needed to support the process.

### The Future
Following the release of the **MVP** to a select beta group, we will closely monitor performance, gather user feedback, and iterate before rolling it out to a broader audience. Looking ahead, we have **ambitious plans** to further integrate AI across other areas of our product, ensuring that we continue to deliver **meaningful value** to our customers.
