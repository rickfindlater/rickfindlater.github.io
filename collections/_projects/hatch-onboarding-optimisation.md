### The opportunity

I joined Hatch in 2021 as a product designer to help create a new team focused on experience and conversion rate optimisation.

After some research assessing the performance of the various parts of the Hatch app it became obvious that the area that needed the most attention was the customer onboarding funnel.

Specially this meant helping a customer go from signing up through to becoming a successfull investor.

### My role

As a product designer my role included working closely with a data specialist to identify the main gaps in the funnel then, through experimentation, design and deliver solutions iteratively.

### Step one - Creating a benchmark

Our first step was to assess the performance of the current onboarding process which consisted of a series of emails being sent out in succession over a couple of weeks. We measured open and click rates as well common activities that users performed in the app after receiving one of these emails. From this we were able to create a benchmark to measure the success of all changes we made.

### Step two - Initial design and experimentation

Once we had a benchmark set we went to work designing several possible solutions . We made the decision to start with emails as these were able to be designed and built inside a tool called Intercom. This enabled us to deliver, measure and iterate faster that we could if we were operating inside the normal product delivery process. 

Intercom also enabled us to easily set up and report on multivariate testing of the emails we designed as well as include content personalised to individual users based on actions they had already taken in the Hatch app.

### Step two - First results

After implementation of the new email series we began measuring how far users were getting though the new funnel. Almost immediately we began to see an increase in the percentage of Hatch users completing the funnel and going on to become successful investors.

### Step two - Ongoing work

Having tightened the email onboarding funnel we then moved on to creating a series of in app product tours using the same process as we did for the emails. These were designed to introduce users to key feaures if they had not already discovered them themselves.

Again we began to see significant increase in the amount of users once we implimented this new series. Following on from this we planned to do the same using other onboarding methods such as SMS and push notifications.
