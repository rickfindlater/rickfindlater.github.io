### The opportunity

Once I started at Melon it soon became clear that the Melon brand needed a refresh. It felt unfinished and suffering from a lack of cohesion, which was having a negative impact on our position in the market as well as company culture. I convinced the other senior leaders at Melon that we needed to embark upon a rebranding project.

### My role

I am not a brand designer by trade so I decided to enlist the help of a branding agency I had worked with previously. I contacted them and together we developed a plan of attack.

### Step one - brand strategy workshop

For the first phase of the rebrand we gathered all the stakeholders together and undertook a series of brand strategy workshops over a period of 2 days. The brand workshops were facilitated by the branding agency and were a huge success.

### Step two - presentation from agency and feedback

After the branding workshops, the agency presented back to us a branding DNA document which summarised and formalised the results of the workshops. After a couple of iterations on this we decided we wanted to take things further and asked the agency to work on some branding guidelines that we could use to apply the Melon brand to our products, print materials and other collateral. This resulted in a Melon style guide document and some practical assets such as illustrations, imagery and font specifications.

### Step three - ongoing work

The Melon brand continued to evolve as we applied it to our products and other collateral. I also began working on creating a public facing branding website to document Melons brand values, product design principles and design system.
