### The Opportunity

After joining Melon, it quickly became clear that the brand lacked cohesion and felt unfinished. This inconsistency was not only affecting our market positioning but also influencing company culture.

Recognising the need for a refresh, I made the case to senior leadership that a **strategic rebrand** would help strengthen both our external identity and internal alignment. With their support, we embarked on a full-scale rebranding project.

### My Role

While I am not a brand designer by trade, I had experience working with branding professionals. To ensure we achieved the best results, I partnered with a branding agency I had previously collaborated with. Together, we developed a structured plan to redefine Melon’s identity.

### Step One – Brand Strategy Workshop

We kicked off the project with an **intensive two-day brand strategy workshop** involving key stakeholders. Facilitated by the branding agency, these sessions helped us:

- Define Melon’s core values, mission, and positioning
- Identify key brand attributes that would guide our visual and verbal identity
- Align leadership and teams on a shared brand vision

The workshops were a huge success, providing clarity and direction for the rebrand.

### Step Two – Refining the Brand Identity

Following the workshops, the agency presented us with a Brand DNA document, which distilled our discussions into a formalised strategy. After a few iterations, we decided to take things further by developing comprehensive branding guidelines.

The final deliverables included:

- A Melon Style Guide outlining typography, colour schemes, and visual direction
- Practical assets such as illustrations, imagery, and iconography
- Guidelines for applying the brand consistently across products, print materials, and marketing collateral

### Step Three – Ongoing Brand Evolution

As we rolled out the new brand, it continued to evolve through real-world application. To ensure long-term consistency, I initiated the creation of a public-facing brand website that documented:

- Melon’s brand values and identity
- Product design principles
- Our design system for internal and external teams to reference
