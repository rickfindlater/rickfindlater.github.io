### The Opportunity  

In 2018, I was working at **Flux Federation**, the company behind the digital platform that Powershop NZ, UK, and Australia use to retail electricity.  

To remain competitive, the UK and Australian branches needed to start offering natural gas alongside electricity. However, at the time, the Powershop platform only supported electricity sales so we needed to design a solution to introduce gas retailing for these markets.  

### My Role  

As a **Senior Product Designer** at Flux, my role covered:  

- **Research:** Conducting user interviews and usability testing  
- **Design:** Creating wireframes, prototypes, and final UI designs  
- **Collaboration:** Working closely with stakeholders in the UK and Australia to ensure the solution met each market’s unique needs  

### Step One – Research  

To understand how Powershop users wanted to purchase gas alongside electricity, we conducted:  

- **Remote user interviews** with existing Powershop customers in the UK and Australia
- **Stakeholder interviews** with Powershop UK & Australia teams to align on business requirements  

### Step Two – Concept Development & Implementation  

Based on our research, my colleagues and I developed multiple wireframe concepts, exploring different approaches to integrating gas sales.  

1. **Stakeholder feedback:** We presented the wireframes to key stakeholders, refining the ideas down to two potential solutions.  
2. **User testing:** We tested interactive prototypes with real users to determine which solution worked best for both markets.  
3. **Implementation support:** Once the final design was selected, we worked closely with developers to ensure a smooth implementation.  

### Step Three – Ongoing Optimisation  

After the initial solution had been live for a few months, we conducted post-launch user testing:  

- I **flew to Melbourne** to run in-person testing sessions with customers.  
- We engaged a **user research agency in the UK** to gather insights from that market.  

These sessions provided valuable feedback, allowing us to refine and improve the solution based on real user experiences.
