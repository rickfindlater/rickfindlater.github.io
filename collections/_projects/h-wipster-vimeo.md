### The Opportunity  

At the end of 2015, Wipster secured a partnership with Vimeo, one of the global leaders in online video hosting. As part of the deal, we agreed to design and build an advanced **Vimeo integration** into the Wipster app. In return, Vimeo added a link to review videos using Wipster on their video clip page.  

### My Role  

I led a **user testing project** for the Vimeo integration prototype. My responsibilities included:  

- Setting up and running both face-to-face and online user tests
- Traveling to **New York** to conduct user testing with members of the Vimeo team at Vimeo HQ  
- Consolidating feedback and ensuring it was used to refine the integration  

### Step One – Research  

For each user testing session, I video recorded the tests and thoroughly reviewed the footage. I then compiled the main takeaways into a document, which included:  

- Key issues faced by users
- Prioritisation of issues based on frequency  
- Proposed solutions for each issue  

This report was shared with the team and served as the foundation for refining the prototype before development began.  

### Step Two – Implementation  

The insights gained from user testing led to significant **design refinements** before the development phase. By addressing key issues early, we were able to:  

- Save time and money by avoiding costly changes after the integration was built  
- Reduce user churn by delivering a more polished, user-friendly product  

### Step Three – Ongoing Optimisation  

The **Vimeo integration** was a huge success, leading to a significant increase in the number of paid users subscribing to Wipster. After the initial release, we:  

- Monitored **user analytics** to identify areas for improvement  
- Conducted further rounds of user testing, resulting in several **iterations** to optimise the user experience and functionality
