### The Opportunity  

In early 2019, Melon was selected to be part of a new **Ministry of Health initiative**, delivered by Tu Ora Compass Health PHO across the Greater Wellington area. The initiative, called Piki, aimed to provide 18–25-year-olds with mild-to-moderate mental health conditions faster access to age-appropriate support.  

At the time, Melon’s platform wasn’t specifically designed for this age group. To meet the initiative’s goals, we needed to:  

- Develop a **new program of multimedia resources**  
- Make **UX improvements** to our product to better engage younger users  

### My Role  

As **Head of Design** at a small SaaS company, I had to balance **leadership, strategy, and hands-on execution**. For this project, my role spanned:  

- **Planning & strategy** – collaborating with stakeholders to define the approach  
- **Research & user insights** – conducting surveys, interviews, and usability testing  
- **Design & implementation** – directing the design team while working closely with developers  
- **Team leadership** – supporting and guiding my team through tight timelines and limited budgets  

Given the Ministry's urgency to launch a pilot as soon as possible, we had to maximise research value within a small initial budget while ensuring meaningful impact.  

### Step One – Research  

A colleague and I designed and executed a **research program** that included:  

- **Surveys** to gather broad insights  
- **User interviews** to explore real needs and pain points  
- **Usability testing** to validate early ideas  

From this, we created an initial set of **wireframe concepts**, helping us determine:  

- The types of **resources** that would be most valuable  
- The **UX changes** needed to better engage 18–25-year-olds  

### Step Two – Concept Development & Implementation  

Our research showed that a major redesign of the resources section in Melon's web and mobile apps was necessary.  

To ensure early collaboration and alignment, we:  

1. **Reported back key findings** to stakeholders, developers, and testers  
2. **Worked with the wider team** to develop initial concepts for the redesigned resources section  
3. **Conducted user testing** to refine the designs before full implementation  

Alongside these product changes, we also provided critical insights to our clinical team, helping shape new content specifically tailored to our target age group.  

### Step Three – Ongoing Optimisation  

To ensure continuous improvement, we embedded comprehensive analytics tracking into the initial release.

Post-launch, we:  

- Analysed user behaviour data
- Conducted additional user testing & interviews
- Released multiple iterative updates based on our findings  

This data-driven, user-focused approach allowed us to continually refine the experience, ensuring Piki provided real value to its target audience.
