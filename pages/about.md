# I love creating joyful experiences that make technology accessible and empower people to achieve their goals

With over 15 years of experience spanning product and UX design, product management, leadership, web development, and customer success, I’ve had the privilege of working in a variety of businesses alongside diverse teams.

I firmly believe that building exceptional products is a team sport. Throughout my career, I’ve worked within cross-functional teams, fostering collaboration with colleagues and stakeholders to deliver outstanding outcomes for customers.

As a leader, I’ve managed and guided product teams, finding great fulfilment in coaching, mentoring, and supporting others to excel in their work. Helping others grow and achieve their potential is a core part of what drives me.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, playing squash, skiing, swimming, cooking, and exploring new destinations through travel.
